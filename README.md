# A new neofetch

Decided to make this to learn some bash scripting. Won't work on some systems because I'm lazy.

Options:
* h to show help menu.
* n to not show ascii art.
* 1-3 to select ascii art, 1 is default.

### TODO
* Add distro ascii.
* Make it work on most systems.
* Add more data to it.
* ~~Add colors and make it more readable.~~
